🖼️ Photo Editor with OpenCV & Gemini API

A simple yet powerful photo editor built with Python, combining OpenCV for core image processing and the Gemini API for AI-powered, prompt-driven edits. Users can apply filters, transformations, and effects the traditional way, or simply describe the changes they want in natural language and let the editor handle the rest. With Streamlit providing a clean and interactive interface, the app makes photo editing intuitive, fun, and smart — blending classic image processing with modern AI capabilities.
